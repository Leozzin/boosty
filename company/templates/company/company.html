<p>The starting state of the menu will appear collapsed on smaller screens, and will appear non-collapsed on larger screens. When toggled using the button below, the menu will change.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep all page content within the class. The top navbar is optional, and just for demonstration. Just create an element with the menu ID which will toggle the menu when clicked.</p>
